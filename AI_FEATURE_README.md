# ðŸ§  AI Seizure Risk Prediction Feature

## Overview
This feature implements an intelligent seizure risk prediction system that analyzes patient medical data to provide neurologists with AI-powered insights for better patient care.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Risk Prediction Algorithm
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Considers seizure frequency, patient age, symptom complexity, and medical history
- **Risk Scoring**: Generates confidence scores (0-100%) with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk classifications
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Provides personalized treatment suggestions based on risk level

### ðŸ“Š AI Insights Dashboard
- **Real-time Predictions**: Generate new predictions for any patient
- **Historical Tracking**: View prediction history and trends
- **High-Risk Alerts**: Prioritizes patients requiring immediate attention

### ðŸ”¬ Machine Learning Logic
The AI system analyzes:
- **Seizure Patterns**: Frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/rarely)
- **Temporal Factors**: Days since last seizure
- **Patient Demographics**: Age and gender considerations
- **Symptom Complexity**: Natural language processing of symptom descriptions
- **Medical History**: Total seizures and average duration

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- **AISeizurePredictionService**: Core ML logic and risk calculation
- **AIController**: REST endpoints for predictions
- **AIAnalysis Entity**: Stores prediction results with JSON metadata

### Frontend (React Native)
- **AIInsights Component**: Interactive dashboard for neurologists
- **AI Service**: API integration and data parsing
- **Integrated UI**: Seamless integration with existing neurologist workflow

## API Endpoints

```
POST /api/ai/predict-seizure-risk/{patientId}
GET /api/ai/patient-predictions/{patientId}
GET /api/ai/dashboard-insights
```

## Risk Calculation Formula

```
Risk Score = (Seizure Frequency Ã— 0.4) + 
             (Days Since Last Seizure Ã— 0.2) + 
             (Total Seizures Ã— 0.2) + 
             (Symptom Complexity Ã— 0.1) + 
             (Age Factor Ã— 0.1)
```

## Usage

### For Neurologists:
1. Navigate to the "ðŸ§  AI" tab in the dashboard
2. Select a patient to generate a new prediction
3. View risk level, confidence score, and recommendations
4. Access detailed prediction history

### Quick Prediction:
- Use the "ðŸ§  AI Risk" button in patient form details for instant analysis

## Benefits

- **Early Intervention**: Identify high-risk patients before seizure events
- **Personalized Care**: Tailored recommendations based on individual risk factors
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly fits into existing medical workflow
- **Evidence-Based**: Uses comprehensive patient data for accurate predictions

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with wearable devices for real-time monitoring
- Advanced ML models with larger datasets
- Predictive analytics for medication effectiveness
- Integration with hospital systems for automated alerts
